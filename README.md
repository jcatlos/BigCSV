# BigCSV .csv file editor
BigCSV is a cross-platform command line utility for displaying, manipulating and filtering large .csv files.

## Features:
* View, sort and filter .csv files of (almost) any size
* Export query results into separate files
* SQL-like syntax
* Schema-independent - Work with multiple data sources as one table

## Installation
Make sure, you have installed and running **cmake (3.15 or newer)** and a compiler supporting **C++ 17**.

### Linux
Open the cloned repository and run these commands in your terminal:

``` shell
rm -r build         # To make sure, the build folder is not present
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
This approach may work on Windows, as well, however it has not been tested
### Windows
Use cmake GUI application. Select the cloned repository as the source directory and a subdirectory `build` as the build directory. Only the MinGW make configuration has been tested.

---

Afterwards, the program is ready to be used. The executable is located in the `build` folder

## Usage
The utility takes arguements via the standrd input. To create and use a script, just write it down to a text file and launch the utility by `BigCSV < [file_name]`.

> **Note:** All tables are stored only in memory. Therefore any modifications performed by changing output attributes or using the `UPDATE` are not saved. If you wish to save them, use the `SELECT` command with the `INTO` clause to save the chnges into a file which can be then loaded as a separate table.

Command are always ended by a semicolon `;`. All tokens are divided by any whitespace. A token containing a whitespoace must be inside double quotes `"`.

> **Note:** The command parsing process  commands until the next `;` before any text processing happens. This results in the inability to use the semicolon character in the shell environment.

If an error is encountered while parsing a command, no changes to the tables happen.

### Paths
When using a path, use `/` as directory separator, even on Windows. Also note that the executable is located in the `build` directory. Relative paths are acceptable.

## Commands
There are 6 commands available: `CREATE TABLE` for creating a table to work with, `ALTER TABLE` to modify its attributes, `INSERT` to add source files into a table, `UPDATE` to modify data in a table, `SELECT` to display data currently in a table and `EXIT` to exit the utility. 


### CREATE TABLE
**Syntax:** `CREATE TABLE table_name [SET att=val … ];`

Creates a table named `table_name`. If a value of an attribute is not provided, a default value is used. Attributes and their default values are explained in the [Attributes section](#Table-attributes).

### ALTER TABLE
**Syntax:** `ALTER TABLE table_name [SET att=val … ];`

Alters an existing table with name `table_name` by modifying its [attributes](#Table-attributes). Previous values of attributes are taken as the default values.

### INSERT
**Syntax:** `INSERT INTO table_name FILE path [DELIMITER=delim] [ENDLINE=endl] [QUOTECHAR=qchar]`

Adds a file located at `path` to an existing table `table_name` as a source of data. **In no moment is the soucre file modified.** `DELIMITER`, `ENDLINE` and `QUOTECHAR` signify the delimiter of the tokens, the delimiter of the rows and th character used to optionally encapsulate tokens of the file. If none given, the values of `IN_DELIMITER`, `IN_ENDLINE` and `IN_QUOTECHAR` of the table `table_name` are used.

> **Note:** Shell not check for the existence of the provided file. If a non-existing file there should be no problems, however this was not tested.

> **Note:** Setting other attributes does not throw an error, however their values are ignored.

### UPDATE
**Syntax:** `UPDATE table_name SET col1=val1 … [WHERE cond ...];`

Modifies the values in the existing table `table_name` by setting the specified columns to specified values. This modification can be restricted by the `WHERE` clause. Then only the rows fullfilling all conditions in the clause are modified. In the process of the modification, all the source files are copied into [temporary files]. 

### SELECT
**Syntax:** `SELECT col1 … coln FROM table_name [WHERE [cond ...]] [ORDER BY col1 … ] [INTO path];`

Prints the columns specified by their names in the source files from an existing table `table_name`. These results may be filtered by the `WHERE` clause and ordered by the `ORDER BY` clause. If a `INTO` clause is present, the output is instead saved into provided relative path `path`. Errors and warnings are still printed to the standard error output.

The columns of the `ORDER BY` clause *must* be a subset of the selected columns.
By using the `ORDER BY` clause, the sorting process is started. The files are distributed into temporary partition files of [`MAX_FILESIZE`](#Table-attributes), which are sorted in memory and then merged into one file.

### WHERE clause
**Syntax:** `WHERE [condition1 ...]`
This clause is used to filter the rows of a query by provided conditions in the form of `col_name [operator] value`. `col_name` is a name of a column in the table and `value` is a constant. There are currently 3 operators in the utility: string equality (`=`), integer greater than, and lower than (`>` and `<`, respectively). **All** conditions must hold for the row to be selected.

## Table attributes
All attributes except the `MAX_FILESIZE` are characters. If more than one character is provided, the first one is taken as the value.

Attribute | Default value | Meaning
--- | ---: | ---
`IN_DELIMITER` | `;` | The default value of the token delimiter used in the input tables.
`IN_QUOTECHAR` | `"` | The default value of the optional token encapsulation character used in the input tables.
`IN_ENDLINE` | `\n` | The default value of the row delimiter used in the input tables.
`OUT_DELIMITER` | `;` | The token delimiter used in the ouput.
`OUT_QUOTECHAR` | `"` | The token encapsulation character used in the output (on all tokens)
`OUT_ENDLINE` | `\n` | The row delimiter used in the ouput.
`MAX_FILESIZE` | `13500` | The size of a file that can be sorted in memory. Take into account, that the actual size of the files is slightly higher

> **Note:** The table is distriubuted into temporary files by rows. The condition is checked **After** a row was inserted, therefore, counterintuitevely, the resulting files are slightly larger. However this apporach allows to set the `MAX_FILES` = 0 to bypass the in-memory sorting.
