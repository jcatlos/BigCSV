# Technical documentation
This document serves to depict the internal workings of the BigCSV command line utility, as well as the whole BigCSV namespace. 

## Structure

Then there are `main.cpp` file serving to launch an instance of `Shell` and `helper.hpp` and `helper.cpp` containing functions not associated to any class.
